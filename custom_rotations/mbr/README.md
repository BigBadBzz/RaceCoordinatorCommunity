These custom rotation files have been extensively tested but are not 100% guaranteed to be error free. Should you find any errors please let us know so they can be corrected for everybody’s benefit.  To use these heat rotations simply select the ‘custom rotation’ in the heat manager and add each of the files provided.  They are intended to provide a random(ish) rotation with drivers running heats at regular intervals, so that if possible no driver runs back to back heats and races as many different opponents as possible. Obviously, there are severe limitations to this with low numbers (below 10) of drivers as the math doesn’t work out well.
