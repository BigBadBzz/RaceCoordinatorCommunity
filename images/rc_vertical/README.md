# Info
The files in this package can be directly copied over the original RC files. Doing so will cause all your existing configurations (race and driver) to automatically use them. However, this is strongly discouraged. The RC installer will overwrite these files if/when you install a new version of RC and you would have to re-copy them over. It's better to bite the bullet and copy these files to a local directory on your computer, then change your race/driver configurations to point to the new files.  

These are the original RC images turned 90 degress so they're vertical instead of horizontal.  It's hard to tell but there may be a thin border framing the images making them easier to see depending on the lane color.
